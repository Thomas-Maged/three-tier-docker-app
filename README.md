# three-tier-docker-app
Three-Tier Dockerized Application follows Docker best practices, using a multi-stage build for the backend, a database with host-stored credentials, and an NGINX reverse proxy for HTTPS. Each component runs in its own container, and the entire system is managed with Docker Compose, allowing easy deployment and teardown with a single command. ðŸš€
